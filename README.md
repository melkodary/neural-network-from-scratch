### Project Overview <a name="overview"></a>
This project implements neural networks from scratch. This means no external ML libraries are used. 

### Installation <a name="installation"></a>
1. Make sure that python is installed by issuing this command on the terminal:
```sh
$ python --version
```
2. Also you could follow the steps for installing pip, if not installed, over [here][pip-install] 
3. (optional) create a separate python env. Here is how to create [virtual env][env-install]
4. Execute this command: _(This should download all necessary packages for running this project)_.
```sh
$ pip install requirements.txt
```
5. Download the datasets.
```
$ cd data
$ ./get_datasets.sh
```

### Acknowledgments
